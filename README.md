# COVID-ShinyApp
sample Shiny app, needs a lot of additional work, but something i put together in a couple hours.

Run COVID_script to pull data from COVID Tracking api. 

Install the ScheduleR package and then in RStudio browse to 'Tools'-->'Add Ins'-->'Browse Add Ins' and select Task ScheduleR to schedule the COVID_Script to automatically download and transform the COVID data from the CovidTracking API.
